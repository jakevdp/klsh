klsh
====

Python implementation of Kernelized Locality Sensitive Hashing.

This repository is a work in progress.

The method is described in [Kulis & Grauman 2009](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~kulis/klsh/klsh.htm)

You can see a set of benchmarks for the linear kernel here in [benchmarks/kernel_benchmarks.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/klsh/blob/master/benchmarks/kernel_benchmarks.ipynb)
